# NModel
NModel fork from nmodel.codeplex.com

NModel is a model basded checking tool.

NModel hasn't changed in ages, but it still utilizes the .Net 2.0 and MSGlee for graph visualization.

This fork moves NModel to .Net 4.0 and builds against Microsft's now opensource version of AutomaticGraphLayout 
(the successor to GLEE which didn't use to be open source).
